## Description

This project was created as part of CIS 185 - Fall 2025, Week 2 assignment.     
The goal was to create a webpage using HTML and CSS, showing the proper use of semantic structure, styling, and responsive design techniques.   
The page includes sections for an introduction, sample projects (I used images of my puppy.), and a contact section. the design uses both Flexbox and grid layouts, external styling through a linked CSS file, and a clean, basic aesthetic suitable for an online portfolio.
